This folder contains code adapted from etcpack by ERICSSON ///.

The license comments have been left at the top of each file, but some code may have moved around.

See LICENSE.TXT for details. It says that use of the code is limited to applications using the
code to compress textures for use with a Khronos-derived API. This game engine only supports
OpenGL ES 2.0, which certainly qualifies, so there is no issue there.
